def FEM_1D_local_elastic_stiffness_CC0_H3_T1(x_elem: np.ndarray, E: float, A: float, n_gauss: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute the local stiffness matrix for a 1D linear elastic bar element 
    using the Galerkin finite element formulation.
    Parameters:
        x_elem (np.ndarray): Array of nodal coordinates for the element [x1, x2]
            (shape: [2,]).
        E (float): Young's modulus of the material.
        A (float): Cross-sectional area of the bar.
        n_gauss (int, optional): Number of Gauss integration points. 
            Defaults to 2, which is exact for linear elements.
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: 2×2 element stiffness matrix representing 
            the relation between nodal displacements and forces.
