# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
{{ signature }}
{{ docstring }}

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Function Signature:
## Test Functions to Implement:
{% if test_cases %}
{% for test in test_cases %}
- {{ test.name }}: "{{ test.doc }}"
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- (no test cases found)
{% endif %}

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
