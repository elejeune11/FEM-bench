def elastic_critical_load_analysis_frame_3D_part_self_contained(node_coords: np.ndarray, elements: Sequence[dict], boundary_conditions: dict[int, Sequence[int | bool]], nodal_loads: dict[int, Sequence[float]]):
    """
    Perform linear (eigenvalue) buckling analysis for a 3D frame and return the
    elastic critical load factor and associated global buckling mode shape.

    Overview
    --------
    The routine:
      1) Assembles the global elastic stiffness matrix `K`.
      2) Assembles the global reference load vector `P`.
      3) Solves the linear static problem `K u = P` (with boundary conditions) to
         obtain the displacement state `u` under the reference load.
      4) Assembles the geometric stiffness `K_g` consistent with that state.
      5) Solves the generalized eigenproblem on the free DOFs,
             K φ = -λ K_g φ,
         and returns the smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` as the elastic
         critical load factor and its corresponding global mode shape `φ`
         (constrained DOFs set to zero).

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : (n_nodes, 3) ndarray of float
        Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) for each node, indexed 0..n_nodes-1.
    elements : Sequence[dict]
        Element definitions consumed by the assembly routines. Each dictionary
        must supply properties for a 2-node 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam aligned with
        its local x-axis. Required keys (minimum):
          Topology
          --------
          - 'node_i' : int
                Start node index (0-based).
          - 'node_j' : int
                End node index (0-based).
          Material
          --------
          - 'E' : float
                Young's modulus (used in axial, bending, and torsion terms).
          - 'nu' : float
                Poisson's ratio (used in torsion only).
          Section (local axes y,z about the beam's local x)
          -----------------------------------------------
          - 'A'  : float
                Cross-sectional area.
          - 'I_y' : float
                Second moment of area about local y.
          - 'I_z' : float
                Second moment of area about local z.
          - 'J'  : float
                Torsional constant (for elastic/torsional stiffness).
          - 'I_rho' : float
                Polar moment about the local x-axis used by the geometric stiffness
                with torsion–bending coupling.
          Orientation
          -----------
          - 'local_z' : Sequence[float] of length 3 **or** None
                Provide a 3-vector giving the direction of the element's local z-axis to 
                disambiguate the local triad used in the 12×12 transformation; if `None`, 
                a default convention is applied.

    boundary_conditions : dict
        Dictionary mapping node index -> boundary condition specification. Each
        node's specification can be provided in either of two forms:
        - Sequence of 6 booleans: [ux, uy, uz, rx, ry, rz], where True means
          the DOF is constrained (fixed).
        - Sequence of integer indices: e.g. [0, 1, 2] means the DOFs ux, uy, uz
          at that node are fixed.
        All constrained DOFs are removed from the free set. It is the caller’s
        responsibility to supply constraints sufficient to eliminate rigid-body
        modes.

    nodal_loads : dict[int, Sequence[float]]
        Mapping from node index → length-6 vector of load components applied at
        that node in the **global** DOF order `[F_x, F_y, F_z, M_x, M_y, M_z]`.
        Used to form `P`.

    Returns
    -------
    elastic_critical_load_factor : float
        The smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` (> 0). If `P` is the reference load
        used to form `K_g`, then the predicted elastic buckling load is
        `P_cr = λ · P`.
    deformed_shape_vector : (6*n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global buckling mode vector with constrained DOFs set to zero. No
        normalization is applied (mode scale is arbitrary; only the shape matters).

    Assumptions
    -----------
    - Frame elements possess 6 DOF per node and use global DOF order
      `[u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z]`.
    - Small-displacement (eigenvalue) buckling theory: geometric nonlinearity is
      represented via `K_g` assembled at the reference load state, not via a full
      nonlinear equilibrium/path-following analysis.
    - Boundary conditions must remove rigid-body modes from the free set.
    - Units are consistent across coordinates, properties, and loads.

    External Helper Functions (required)
    ------------------------------------
    - `local_elastic_stiffness_matrix_3D_beam(E, nu, A, L, I_y, I_z, J) -> (12,12) ndarray`
        Local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam aligned with
        the local x-axis.
    - `local_geometric_stiffness_matrix_3D_beam(L, A, I_rho, Fx2, Mx2, My1, Mz1, My2, Mz2) -> (12,12) ndarray`
        Local geometric stiffness matrix with torsion-bending coupling.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Propagated from called routines if:
        - BCs are invalid or leave rigid-body modes in the free set.
        - Reduced matrices are singular/ill-conditioned beyond tolerances.
        - No positive eigenvalue is found or eigenpairs are significantly complex.

    Notes
    -----
    - The scale of `deformed_shape_vector` is arbitrary; normalize for plotting
      if desired (e.g., by max absolute translational DOF).
    - If multiple nearly-equal smallest eigenvalues exist (mode multiplicity),
      the returned mode can depend on numerical details.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Function Signature:
## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_euler_buckling_cantilever_circular_param_sweep: "Cantilever (fixed-free) circular column aligned with +z.
Sweep through radii r ∈ {0.5, 0.75, 1.0} and lengths L ∈ {10, 20, 40}.
For each case, run the full pipeline and compare λ·P_ref to the Euler cantilever value analytical solution.
Use 10 elements, set tolerances to be appropriate for the anticipated discretization error at 10-5."
- test_orientation_invariance_cantilever_buckling_rect_section: "Orientation invariance test with a rectangular section (Iy ≠ Iz).

The cantilever model is solved in its original orientation and again after applying
a rigid-body rotation R to the geometry, element axes, and applied load. The critical
load factor λ should be identical in both cases.

The buckling mode from the rotated model should equal the base mode transformed by R:
- Build T as a block-diagonal matrix with R applied to both the translational
  [ux, uy, uz] and rotational [θx, θy, θz] DOFs at each node.
- Then mode_rot ≈ T @ mode_base, allowing for arbitrary scale and sign."
- test_cantilever_euler_buckling_mesh_convergence: "Verify mesh convergence for Euler buckling of a fixed–free circular cantilever.
The test refines the beam discretization and checks that the numerical critical load
approaches the analytical Euler value with decreasing relative error, and that the
finest mesh achieves very high accuracy."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
