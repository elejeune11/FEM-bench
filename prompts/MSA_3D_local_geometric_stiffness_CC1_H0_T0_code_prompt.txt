def MSA_3D_local_geometric_stiffness_CC1_H0_T0(L: float, A: float, I_rho: float, Fx2: float, Mx2: float, My1: float, Mz1: float, My2: float, Mz2: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return the 12x12 local geometric stiffness matrix with torsion-bending coupling for a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam element.

    The beam is assumed to be aligned with the local x-axis. The geometric stiffness matrix is used in conjunction with the elastic stiffness matrix for nonlinear structural analysis.

    Degrees of freedom are ordered as:
        [u1, v1, w1, θx1, θy1, θz1, u2, v2, w2, θx2, θy2, θz2]

    Where:
        - u, v, w: displacements along local x, y, z axes
        - θx, θy, θz: rotations about local x, y, z axes
        - Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to nodes i and j of the element

    Parameters:
        L (float): Length of the beam element [length units]
        A (float): Cross-sectional area [length² units]
        I_rho (float): Polar moment of inertia about the x-axis [length⁴ units]
        Fx2 (float): Internal axial force in the element (positive = tension), evaluated at node 2 [force units]
        Mx2 (float): Torsional moment at node 2 about x-axis [forcexlength units]
        My1 (float): Bending moment at node 1 about y-axis [forcexlength units]
        Mz1 (float): Bending moment at node 1 about z-axis [forcexlength units]
        My2 (float): Bending moment at node 2 about y-axis [forcexlength units]
        Mz2 (float): Bending moment at node 2 about z-axis [forcexlength units]

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A 12x12 symmetric geometric stiffness matrix in local coordinates.
                    Positive axial force (tension) contributes to element stiffness;
                    negative axial force (compression) can lead to instability.

    Notes:
    Effects captured
        * Axial load stiffening/softening (second order “P-Δ” and “P-θ” effects):
        + **Tension (+Fx2)** increases lateral/torsional stiffness.
        + Compression (-Fx2) decreases it and may trigger buckling when K_e + K_g becomes singular.
        * Coupling of torsion (Mx2) with bending about the local y and z axes.
        * Coupling between end bending moments (My, Mz) and both transverse displacements and rotations (“moment-displacement” and “moment-rotation”).
        * Interaction between the two element nodes (no lumping of geometric terms).

    Implementation details
        * Consistent 12 x 12 matrix for an Euler-Bernoulli beam.
        * Cross-section assumed prismatic and doubly symmetric; no shear deformation, non-uniform torsion, or Wagner warping effects are included.
        * Intended for second-order geometric nonlinear analysis, large displacement static equilibrium, and eigenvalue based buckling calculations.
        * Inputs `Fx2`, `Mx2`, `My1`, `Mz1`, `My2`, `Mz2` are normally taken from the element's internal force vector at the start of the load increment/Newton iteration.
        * Valid in a small strain, moderate rotation framework (Δ L large, ε small).
