# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports: import numpy as np
import pytest
from typing import Tuple
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)


## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def quad8_shape_functions_and_derivatives(xi: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Vectorized evaluation of quadratic (8-node) quadrilateral shape functions and derivatives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xi : np.ndarray
        Natural coordinates (ξ, η) in the reference square.
        - Shape (2,) for a single point, or (n, 2) for a batch of points.
        - Components must be finite (no NaN or Inf). Domain is typically [-1, 1]^2.

    Returns
    -------
    N : np.ndarray
        Shape functions evaluated at the input points. Shape: (n, 8, 1).
        Node order: [N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8].
    dN_dxi : np.ndarray
        Partial derivatives w.r.t. (ξ, η). Shape: (n, 8, 2).
        Columns correspond to [∂()/∂ξ, ∂()/∂η] in the same node order.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `xi` is not a NumPy array.
        If `xi` has shape other than (2,) or (n, 2).
        If `xi` contains non-finite values (NaN or Inf).

    Notes
    -----
    Shape functions:
        N1 = -1/4 (1-ξ)(1-η)(1+ξ+η)
        N2 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1-η)(ξ-η-1)
        N3 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1+η)(ξ+η-1)
        N4 =  +1/4 (1-ξ)(1+η)(η-ξ-1)
        N5 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1-η)
        N6 =  +1/2 (1+ξ)(1-η²)
        N7 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1+η)
        N8 =  +1/2 (1-ξ)(1-η²)
    """

# Output:
# Only return the complete Python function — no extra text, explanation, or formatting.
