# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports:
import numpy as np
import pytest
from typing import Callable
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)

## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def MSA_3D_assemble_global_load_CC0_H0_T0(nodal_loads: dict, n_nodes: int):
    """
    Assemble the global nodal load vector for a 3D linear-elastic frame structure.
    Constructs the global right-hand-side vector (P) for the equilibrium equation:
        K * u = P
    where K is the assembled global stiffness matrix and u is the global displacement
    vector. Each node contributes up to six DOFs corresponding to forces and moments
    in the global Cartesian frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodal_loads : dict[int, array-like of float]
        Mapping from node index (0-based) to a 6-component load vector:
            [F_x, F_y, F_z, M_x, M_y, M_z]
        representing forces (N) and moments (N·m) applied at that node in
        **global coordinates**. Nodes not listed are assumed to have zero loads.
    n_nodes : int
        Total number of nodes in the structure. Must be consistent with the
        indexing used in `nodal_loads`.
    Returns
    -------
    P : (6 * n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global load vector containing all nodal forces and moments.
        DOF ordering per node: [UX, UY, UZ, RX, RY, RZ].
        Entries for unconstrained or unloaded nodes are zero.
    Notes
    -----
    - DOF indices are 0-based and grouped sequentially by node:
        DOFs for node n → [6*n, 6*n+1, 6*n+2, 6*n+3, 6*n+4, 6*n+5].
    - Loads are assumed to be applied in the global coordinate system.
    - Input vectors are automatically converted to float.
