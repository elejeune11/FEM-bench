def MSA_3D_assemble_global_geometric_stiffness_CC1_H4_T3(node_coords: np.ndarray, elements: Sequence[dict], u_global: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Assemble the global geometric (initial-stress) stiffness matrix K_g for a 3D frame
    under a given global displacement state.

    Each 2-node Euler–Bernoulli beam contributes a 12×12 local geometric stiffness
    matrix k_g^local that depends on the element length and the internal end
    force/moment resultants induced by the current displacement state. The local
    matrix is then mapped to global coordinates with a 12×12 direction-cosine
    transformation Γ and scattered into the global K_g.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : (n_nodes, 3) ndarray of float
        Global Cartesian coordinates [x, y, z] of each node (0-based indexing).
    elements : sequence of dict
        Per-element dictionaries. Required keys per element:
            'E' : float
                Young's modulus (Pa).
            'nu' : float
                Poisson's ratio (unitless).
            'A' : float
                Cross-sectional area (m²).
            'I_y', 'I_z' : float
                Second moments of area about the local y- and z-axes (m⁴).
            'J' : float
                Torsional constant (m⁴).
            'local_z' : array-like of shape (3,), optional
                Unit vector in global coordinates defining the local z-axis orientation.
                Must not be parallel to the beam axis. If None, a default is chosen (see Notes).
    u_global : (6*n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global displacement vector with 6 DOF per node in the order
        [u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z] for node 0, then node 1, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    K : (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes) ndarray of float
        Assembled global geometric stiffness matrix. For conservative loading and
        the standard formulation, K_g is symmetric.

    Notes
    -----
    - Local axes are right-handed.
    - Default orientation rule for `local_z` (reference vector): use the global z-axis
      unless the beam axis is aligned with global z, in which case use the global y-axis.
      The 'local_z' must be unit length and not parallel to the beam axis.
    - Internal end forces used to parameterize k_g^local are elastic internal reactions
      induced by the supplied displacement state (not external loads). Their local DOF
      ordering is the same as for local displacements:
      [u1, v1, w1, θx1, θy1, θz1, u2, v2, w2, θx2, θy2, θz2] ↔
      [Fx_i, Fy_i, Fz_i, Mx_i, My_i, Mz_i, Fx_j, Fy_j, Fz_j, Mx_j, My_j, Mz_j].
    - Elements that share nodes contribute additively to common global DOFs.
    - A zero-length element or invalid `local_z` (non-unit or parallel to the axis)
      should be treated as an error by the transformation routine.

    Effects captured in the geometric stiffness matrix:
        * Axial load stiffening/softening (second order “P-Δ” and “P-θ” effects):
        + **Tension (+Fx2)** increases lateral/torsional stiffness.
        + Compression (-Fx2) decreases it and may trigger buckling when K_e + K_g becomes singular.
        * Coupling of torsion (Mx2) with bending about the local y and z axes.
        * Coupling between end bending moments (My, Mz) and both transverse displacements and rotations (“moment-displacement” and “moment-rotation”).
        * Interaction between the two element nodes (no lumping of geometric terms).
        * Cross-section assumed prismatic and doubly symmetric; no shear deformation, non-uniform torsion, or Wagner warping effects are included.
        * Intended for second-order geometric nonlinear analysis, large displacement static equilibrium, and eigenvalue based buckling calculations.
        * Valid in a small strain, moderate rotation framework (Δ L large, ε small).
