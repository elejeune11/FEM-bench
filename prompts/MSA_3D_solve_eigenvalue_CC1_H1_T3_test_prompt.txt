# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_solve_eigenvalue_CC1_H1_T3(K_e_global: np.ndarray, K_g_global: np.ndarray, boundary_conditions: dict, n_nodes: int):
    """
    Compute the smallest positive elastic critical load factor and corresponding
    global buckling mode shape for a 3D frame/beam model.

    The generalized eigenproblem is solved on the free DOFs:
        K_e_ff * phi = -lambda * K_g_ff * phi
    where K_e_ff and K_g_ff are the partitions of the elastic and geometric
    stiffness matrices after applying boundary conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    K_e_global : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes)
        Global elastic stiffness matrix.
    K_g_global : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes)
        Global geometric stiffness matrix at the reference load state.
    boundary_conditions : dict[int, array-like of bool]
        Dictionary mapping each node index (0-based) to a 6-element boolean array
        defining the constrained DOFs:
            True  → fixed (prescribed zero displacement/rotation)
            False → free (unknown)
        Nodes not listed are assumed fully free.
    n_nodes : int
        Number of nodes in the model (assumes 6 DOFs per node, ordered
        [u_x, u_y, u_z, theta_x, theta_y, theta_z] per node).

    Returns
    -------
    elastic_critical_load_factor : float
        The smallest positive eigenvalue lambda (> 0), interpreted as the elastic
        critical load factor (i.e., P_cr = lambda * P_ref, if K_g_global was
        formed at reference load P_ref).
    deformed_shape_vector : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes,)
        Global buckling mode vector with entries on constrained DOFs set to zero.
        No normalization is applied (matches original behavior).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If the reduced matrices are ill-conditioned/singular beyond tolerance.
            Use a tolerence of 1e16
        - If no positive eigenvalue is found.
        - If eigenpairs contain non-negligible complex parts.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_eigen_known_answer: "Verifies that eigenvalue_analysis produces the correct result in a simple,
analytically solvable case. For example, with diagonal K_e and K_g = -I, the critical
load factors reduce to the diagonal entries of K_e, so the function should
return the smallest one and a mode aligned with the corresponding DOF."
- test_eigen_singluar_detected: "Verify that eigenvalue_analysis raises ValueError when the
reduced elastic block is singular/ill-conditioned."
- test_eigen_complex_eigenpairs_detected: "Verify that eigenvalue_analysis raises ValueError when the generalized
eigenproblem yields significantly complex pairs."
- test_eigen_no_positive_eigenvalues_detected: "Verify that eigenvalue_analysis raises ValueError when no positive
eigenvalues are present."
- test_eigen_invariance_to_reference_load_scaling: "Check that the computed critical load factor scales correctly with the
reference geometric stiffness. Scaling K_g by a constant c should scale
the reported eigenvalue by 1/c, while still returning valid global mode
vectors of the correct size."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
