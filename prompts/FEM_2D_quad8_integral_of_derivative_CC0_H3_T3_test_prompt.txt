# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def FEM_2D_quad8_integral_of_derivative_CC0_H3_T3(node_coords: np.ndarray, node_values: np.ndarray, num_gauss_pts: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute ∫_Ω (∇u) dΩ for a scalar field u defined over a quadratic
    8-node quadrilateral (Q8) finite element.

    The computation uses isoparametric mapping and Gauss–Legendre quadrature
    on the reference domain Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : np.ndarray
        Physical coordinates of the Q8 element nodes.
        Shape: (8, 2). Each row is [x, y].
        Node ordering (must match both geometry and values):
            1: (-1, -1),  2: ( 1, -1),  3: ( 1,  1),  4: (-1,  1),
            5: ( 0, -1),  6: ( 1,  0),  7: ( 0,  1),  8: (-1,  0)
    node_values : np.ndarray
        Scalar nodal values of u. Shape: (8,) or (8, 1).
    num_gauss_pts : int
        Number of quadrature points to use: one of {1, 4, 9}.
        - 1 → 1×1 rule, exact for ≤1st-degree polynomials
        - 4 → 2×2 rule, exact for ≤3rd-degree
        - 9 → 3×3 rule, exact for ≤5th-degree

    Returns
    -------
    integral : np.ndarray
        The vector [∫_Ω ∂u/∂x dΩ, ∫_Ω ∂u/∂y dΩ].
        Shape: (2,).

    Notes
    -----
    Shape functions:
        N1 = -1/4 (1-ξ)(1-η)(1+ξ+η)
        N2 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1-η)(ξ-η-1)
        N3 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1+η)(ξ+η-1)
        N4 =  +1/4 (1-ξ)(1+η)(η-ξ-1)
        N5 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1-η)
        N6 =  +1/2 (1+ξ)(1-η²)
        N7 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1+η)
        N8 =  +1/2 (1-ξ)(1-η²)
    """

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_integral_of_derivative_quad8_identity_cubic: "Validate ∫_Ω (∇u) dΩ for a cubic field on an identity-mapped Q8 element.
A 2×2 Gauss–Legendre rule (num_gauss_pts = 4) is exact for this case,"
- test_integral_of_derivative_quad8_affine_linear_field: "Analytic check with an affine geometric map and a linear field.
Map the reference square Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1] by [x, y]^T = A[ξ, η]^T + c.
For the linear scalar field u(x, y) = α + βx + γy.
Test to make sure the function matches the correct analytical solution."
- test_integral_of_derivative_quad8_order_check_asymmetric_curved: "Check quadrature-order sensitivity on a curved, asymmetric Q8 mapping.
Select a geometry that is intentionally non-affine. With properly selected fixed,
asymmetric nodal values, the integral ∫_Ω (∇u) dΩ should depend on the
quadrature order. The test confirms that results from a 3×3 rule differ from those 
of 1×1 or 2×2, verifying that higher-order integration is sensitive to nonlinear mappings."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
