# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def FEM_2D_quad_quadrature_CC0_H0_T0(num_pts: int) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Return Gauss–Legendre quadrature points and weights for the
    reference square Q = { (xi, eta) : -1 ≤ xi ≤ 1, -1 ≤ eta ≤ 1 }.

    Supported rules (tensor products of 1D Gauss–Legendre):
      - 1 point  : 1×1   (exact for polynomials with degree ≤1 in each variable)
      - 4 points : 2×2   (exact for degree ≤3 in each variable)
      - 9 points : 3×3   (exact for degree ≤5 in each variable)

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_pts : int
        Total number of quadrature points. Must be one of {1, 4, 9}.

    Returns
    -------
    points : (num_pts, 2) float64 ndarray
        Quadrature points [xi, eta] on the reference square.
        Points are returned in *row-major order* (η varies slowest, ξ varies fastest):
        for example, the 2×2 rule yields
            [(-1/√3, -1/√3), (+1/√3, -1/√3),
             (-1/√3, +1/√3), (+1/√3, +1/√3)].
    weights : (num_pts,) float64 ndarray
        Corresponding quadrature weights. Computed as the tensor product
        of 1D Gauss–Legendre weights; their sum equals 4.0, the area of Q.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `num_pts` is not one of {1, 4, 9}.

    Notes
    -----
    - Each 1D Gauss–Legendre rule integrates polynomials of degree ≤(2n−1) exactly.
    - The tensor-product 2D rule is therefore exact for all separable polynomials
      of degree ≤(2n−1) in each variable.
    - The returned ordering and weight normalization are deterministic and part of the API.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_quad_quadrature_2D_invalid_inputs: "Test that quad_quadrature_2D rejects invalid numbers of points.

The quadrature rule only supports 1, 4, or 9 integration points.
Any other request should raise a ValueError."
- test_quad_quadrature_2D_basics: "Test basic structural properties of the quadrature rule for quads.

For each supported rule (1, 4, 9 points):
- The returned points and weights arrays have the correct shapes and dtypes.
- The weights sum to 4.0, which is the exact area of the reference square [-1,1] x [-1,1].
- All quadrature points lie inside the reference square, i.e.
  -1 <= x <= 1 and -1 <= y <= 1."
- test_quad_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_1pt: "Validate the degree-exactness of the 1×1 Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule on the
reference square [-1,1]×[-1,1].

The tensor-product 1-point rule places a single node at the center (0,0) with
weight 4. This integrates exactly any polynomial that is at most degree 1
in each variable, i.e. constants and linear terms in x or y.
For higher-degree terms, the rule is no longer guaranteed to be exact.

Exactness assertions for monomials of degree ≤ 1 should pass.
Non-exactness assertions for quadratics should fail the exactness check
(i.e. the quadrature does not reproduce the analytic integrals)."
- test_quad_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_2x2: "Validate the degree-exactness of the 2×2 Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule on [-1,1]×[-1,1].

The 2-point Gauss–Legendre rule in 1D integrates exactly any polynomial up to degree 3.
Taking the tensor product yields a 2×2 rule in 2D (4 points total), which is exact for
any polynomial with degree ≤ 3 in each variable separately (i.e., cubic polynomials
in x and y).

Exactness assertions for all monomials with per-variable degree ≤ 3 should pass.
Adding quartic terms should break exactness, and the mismatch is detected by the test."
- test_quad_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_3x3: "Validate the degree-exactness of the 3×3 Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule on [-1,1]×[-1,1].

The 3-point Gauss–Legendre rule in 1D integrates polynomials exactly up to degree 5.
Taking the tensor product yields a 3×3 rule in 2D (9 points total), which is exact
for any polynomial where the degree in each variable is ≤ 5.
The rule is not guaranteed to integrate terms with degree 6 or higher in either variable.

Exactness assertions for all monomials with per-variable degree ≤ 5 should pass.
Adding degree-6 terms should break exactness, and the mismatch is detected by the test."
