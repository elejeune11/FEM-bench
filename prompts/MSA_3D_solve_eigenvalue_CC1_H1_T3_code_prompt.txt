# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports:
import numpy as np
import scipy
import pytest
from typing import Callable
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)

## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def MSA_3D_solve_eigenvalue_CC1_H1_T3(K_e_global: np.ndarray, K_g_global: np.ndarray, boundary_conditions: dict, n_nodes: int):
    """
    Compute the smallest positive elastic critical load factor and corresponding
    global buckling mode shape for a 3D frame/beam model.

    The generalized eigenproblem is solved on the free DOFs:
        K_e_ff * phi = -lambda * K_g_ff * phi
    where K_e_ff and K_g_ff are the partitions of the elastic and geometric
    stiffness matrices after applying boundary conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    K_e_global : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes)
        Global elastic stiffness matrix.
    K_g_global : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes)
        Global geometric stiffness matrix at the reference load state.
    boundary_conditions : dict[int, array-like of bool]
        Dictionary mapping each node index (0-based) to a 6-element boolean array
        defining the constrained DOFs:
            True  → fixed (prescribed zero displacement/rotation)
            False → free (unknown)
        Nodes not listed are assumed fully free.
    n_nodes : int
        Number of nodes in the model (assumes 6 DOFs per node, ordered
        [u_x, u_y, u_z, theta_x, theta_y, theta_z] per node).

    Returns
    -------
    elastic_critical_load_factor : float
        The smallest positive eigenvalue lambda (> 0), interpreted as the elastic
        critical load factor (i.e., P_cr = lambda * P_ref, if K_g_global was
        formed at reference load P_ref).
    deformed_shape_vector : ndarray, shape (6*n_nodes,)
        Global buckling mode vector with entries on constrained DOFs set to zero.
        No normalization is applied (matches original behavior).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If the reduced matrices are ill-conditioned/singular beyond tolerance.
            Use a tolerence of 1e16
        - If no positive eigenvalue is found.
        - If eigenpairs contain non-negligible complex parts.
