# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_elastic_critical_load_CC1_H10_T2(node_coords: np.ndarray, elements: Sequence[dict], boundary_conditions: dict[int, Sequence[int]], nodal_loads: dict[int, Sequence[float]]):
    """
    Perform linear (eigenvalue) buckling analysis for a 3D frame and return the
    elastic critical load factor and associated global buckling mode shape.

    Overview
    --------
    The routine:
      1) Assembles the global elastic stiffness matrix `K`.
      2) Assembles the global reference load vector `P`.
      3) Solves the linear static problem `K u = P` (with boundary conditions) to
         obtain the displacement state `u` under the reference load.
      4) Assembles the geometric stiffness `K_g` consistent with that state.
      5) Solves the generalized eigenproblem on the free DOFs,
             K φ = -λ K_g φ,
         and returns the smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` as the elastic
         critical load factor and its corresponding global mode shape `φ`
         (constrained DOFs set to zero).

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : (N, 3) float ndarray
        Global coordinates of the N nodes (row i → [x, y, z] of node i, 0-based).

    elements : iterable of dict
        Each dict must contain:
            'node_i', 'node_j' : int
                End node indices (0-based).
            'E', 'nu', 'A', 'I_y', 'I_z', 'J' : float
                Material and geometric properties.
            'local_z' : array-like of shape (3,), optional
                Unit vector in global coordinates defining the local z-axis orientation.
                Must not be parallel to the beam axis. If None, a default is chosen.
                Default local_z = global z, unless the beam lies along global z — then default local_z = global y.

    boundary_conditions : dict[int, Sequence[int]]
        Maps node index to a 6-element iterable of 0 (free) or 1 (fixed) values.
        Omitted nodes are assumed to have all DOFs free.

    nodal_loads : dict[int, Sequence[float]]
        Maps node index to a 6-element array of applied loads:
        [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz]. Omitted nodes are assumed to have zero loads.

    Returns
    -------
    elastic_critical_load_factor : float
        The smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` (> 0). If `P` is the reference load
        used to form `K_g`, then the predicted elastic buckling load is
        `P_cr = λ · P`.
    deformed_shape_vector : (6*n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global buckling mode vector with constrained DOFs set to zero. No
        normalization is applied (mode scale is arbitrary; only the shape matters).

    Assumptions
    -----------
    - Frame elements possess 6 DOF per node and use global DOF order
      `[u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z]`.
    - Small-displacement (eigenvalue) buckling theory: geometric nonlinearity is
      represented via `K_g` assembled at the reference load state, not via a full
      nonlinear equilibrium/path-following analysis.
    - Boundary conditions must remove rigid-body modes from the free set.
    - Units are consistent across coordinates, properties, and loads.

    Helper Functions (used here)
    ----------------------------
    - `local_geometric_stiffness_matrix_3D_beam(L, A, I_rho, Fx2, Mx2, My1, Mz1, My2, Mz2) -> (12,12) ndarray`
        Returns the 12x12 local geometric stiffness matrix with torsion-bending coupling for a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam element.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Propagated from called routines if:
        - BCs are invalid or leave rigid-body modes in the free set.
        - Reduced matrices are singular/ill-conditioned beyond tolerances.
        - No positive eigenvalue is found or eigenpairs are significantly complex.

    Notes
    -----
    - The scale of `deformed_shape_vector` is arbitrary; normalize for plotting
      if desired (e.g., by max absolute translational DOF).
    - If multiple nearly-equal smallest eigenvalues exist (mode multiplicity),
      the returned mode can depend on numerical details.
    - Effects captured in the geometric stiffness matrix:
        * Axial load stiffening/softening (second order “P-Δ” and “P-θ” effects)
        + **Tension (+Fx2)** increases lateral/torsional stiffness.
        + Compression (-Fx2) decreases it and may trigger buckling when K_e + K_g becomes singular.
        * Coupling of torsion (Mx2) with bending about the local y and z axes.
        * Coupling between end bending moments (My, Mz) and both transverse displacements and rotations (“moment-displacement” and “moment-rotation”).
        * Interaction between the two element nodes (no lumping of geometric terms).
        * Cross-section assumed prismatic and doubly symmetric; no shear deformation, non-uniform torsion, or Wagner warping effects are included.
        * Intended for second-order geometric nonlinear analysis, large displacement static equilibrium, and eigenvalue based buckling calculations.
        * Inputs `Fx2`, `Mx2`, `My1`, `Mz1`, `My2`, `Mz2` are normally taken from the element's internal force vector at the start of the load increment/Newton iteration.
        * Valid in a small strain, moderate rotation framework (Δ L large, ε small).

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_euler_buckling_cantilever_circular_param_sweep: "Cantilever (fixed-free) circular column aligned with +z.
Sweep through radii r ∈ {0.5, 0.75, 1.0} and lengths L ∈ {10, 20, 40}.
For each case, run the full pipeline and compare λ·P_ref to the Euler cantilever value analytical solution.
Use 10 elements, set tolerances to be appropriate for the anticipated discretization error at 10-5."
- test_orientation_invariance_cantilever_buckling_rect_section: "Orientation invariance test with a rectangular section (Iy ≠ Iz).

The cantilever model is solved in its original orientation and again after applying
a rigid-body rotation R to the geometry, element axes, and applied load. The critical
load factor λ should be identical in both cases.

The buckling mode from the rotated model should equal the base mode transformed by R:
- Build T as a block-diagonal matrix with R applied to both the translational
  [ux, uy, uz] and rotational [θx, θy, θz] DOFs at each node.
- Then mode_rot ≈ T @ mode_base, allowing for arbitrary scale and sign."
- test_cantilever_euler_buckling_mesh_convergence: "Verify mesh convergence for Euler buckling of a fixed–free circular cantilever.
The test refines the beam discretization and checks that the numerical critical load
approaches the analytical Euler value with decreasing relative error, and that the
finest mesh achieves very high accuracy."
