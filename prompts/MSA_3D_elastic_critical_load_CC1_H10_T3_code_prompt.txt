def MSA_3D_elastic_critical_load_CC1_H10_T3(node_coords: np.ndarray, elements: Sequence[dict], boundary_conditions: dict[int, Sequence[int]], nodal_loads: dict[int, Sequence[float]]):
    """
    Perform linear (eigenvalue) buckling analysis for a 3D frame and return the
    elastic critical load factor and associated global buckling mode shape.

    Overview
    --------
    The routine:
      1) Assembles the global elastic stiffness matrix `K`.
      2) Assembles the global reference load vector `P`.
      3) Solves the linear static problem `K u = P` (with boundary conditions) to
         obtain the displacement state `u` under the reference load.
      4) Assembles the geometric stiffness `K_g` consistent with that state.
      5) Solves the generalized eigenproblem on the free DOFs,
             K φ = -λ K_g φ,
         and returns the smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` as the elastic
         critical load factor and its corresponding global mode shape `φ`
         (constrained DOFs set to zero).

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : (N, 3) float ndarray
        Global coordinates of the N nodes (row i → [x, y, z] of node i, 0-based).

    elements : iterable of dict
        Each dict must contain:
            'node_i', 'node_j' : int
                End node indices (0-based).
            'E', 'nu', 'A', 'I_y', 'I_z', 'J' : float
                Material and geometric properties.
            'local_z' : array-like of shape (3,), optional
                Unit vector in global coordinates defining the local z-axis orientation.
                Must not be parallel to the beam axis. If None, a default is chosen.
                Default local_z = global z, unless the beam lies along global z — then default local_z = global y.

    boundary_conditions : dict[int, Sequence[int]]
        Maps node index to a 6-element iterable of 0 (free) or 1 (fixed) values.
        Omitted nodes are assumed to have all DOFs free.

    nodal_loads : dict[int, Sequence[float]]
        Maps node index to a 6-element array of applied loads:
        [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz]. Omitted nodes are assumed to have zero loads.

    Returns
    -------
    elastic_critical_load_factor : float
        The smallest positive eigenvalue `λ` (> 0). If `P` is the reference load
        used to form `K_g`, then the predicted elastic buckling load is
        `P_cr = λ · P`.
    deformed_shape_vector : (6*n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global buckling mode vector with constrained DOFs set to zero. No
        normalization is applied (mode scale is arbitrary; only the shape matters).

    Assumptions
    -----------
    - Frame elements possess 6 DOF per node and use global DOF order
      `[u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z]`.
    - Small-displacement (eigenvalue) buckling theory: geometric nonlinearity is
      represented via `K_g` assembled at the reference load state, not via a full
      nonlinear equilibrium/path-following analysis.
    - Boundary conditions must remove rigid-body modes from the free set.
    - Units are consistent across coordinates, properties, and loads.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Propagated from called routines if:
        - BCs are invalid or leave rigid-body modes in the free set.
        - Reduced matrices are singular/ill-conditioned beyond tolerances.
        - No positive eigenvalue is found or eigenpairs are significantly complex.

    Notes
    -----
    - The scale of `deformed_shape_vector` is arbitrary; normalize for plotting
      if desired (e.g., by max absolute translational DOF).
    - If multiple nearly-equal smallest eigenvalues exist (mode multiplicity),
      the returned mode can depend on numerical details.
    - Effects captured in the geometric stiffness matrix:
        * Axial load stiffening/softening (second order “P-Δ” and “P-θ” effects)
        + **Tension (+Fx2)** increases lateral/torsional stiffness.
        + Compression (-Fx2) decreases it and may trigger buckling when K_e + K_g becomes singular.
        * Coupling of torsion (Mx2) with bending about the local y and z axes.
        * Coupling between end bending moments (My, Mz) and both transverse displacements and rotations (“moment-displacement” and “moment-rotation”).
        * Interaction between the two element nodes (no lumping of geometric terms).
        * Cross-section assumed prismatic and doubly symmetric; no shear deformation, non-uniform torsion, or Wagner warping effects are included.
        * Intended for second-order geometric nonlinear analysis, large displacement static equilibrium, and eigenvalue based buckling calculations.
        * Inputs `Fx2`, `Mx2`, `My1`, `Mz1`, `My2`, `Mz2` are normally taken from the element's internal force vector at the start of the load increment/Newton iteration.
        * Valid in a small strain, moderate rotation framework (Δ L large, ε small).
