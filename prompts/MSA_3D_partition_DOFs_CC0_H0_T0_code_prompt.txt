# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports:
import numpy as np
import pytest
from typing import Callable
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)

## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def MSA_3D_partition_DOFs_CC0_H0_T0(boundary_conditions: dict, n_nodes: int):
    """
    Partition global degrees of freedom (DOFs) into fixed and free sets for a 3D frame.

    Purpose
    -------
    For a 3D frame with 6 DOFs per node (3 translations and 3 rotations), this routine
    builds the global index sets of fixed and free DOFs used to assemble, partition,
    and solve the linear system. The global DOF ordering per node is:
        [UX, UY, UZ, RX, RY, RZ].
    Global indices are 0-based and assigned as: DOF_index = 6*node + local_dof.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundary_conditions : dict[int, array-like of bool]
        Maps node index (0-based, in [0, n_nodes-1]) to a 6-length iterable of booleans
        indicating which DOFs are fixed at that node (True = fixed, False = free).
        Nodes not present in the dict are assumed to have all DOFs free.
    n_nodes : int
        Total number of nodes in the structure (N ≥ 0).

    Returns
    -------
    fixed : ndarray of int, shape (n_fixed,)
        Sorted, unique global indices of fixed DOFs (0-based). May be empty if no DOFs are fixed.
    free : ndarray of int, shape (6*N - n_fixed,)
        Sorted, unique global indices of free DOFs (0-based). Disjoint from `fixed`.
        The union of `fixed` and `free` covers all DOFs: {0, 1, ..., 6*N - 1}.
