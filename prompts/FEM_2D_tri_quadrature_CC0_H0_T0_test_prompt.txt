# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def FEM_2D_tri_quadrature_CC0_H0_T0(num_pts: int) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Return quadrature points and weights for numerical integration
    over the reference triangle T = {(x, y): x >= 0, y >= 0, x + y <= 1}.

    Supported rules (standard FEM triangular quadrature)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    1-point rule (degree-1 exact):
        Points and weights:
            (1/3, 1/3)      → weight = 0.5

    3-point rule (degree-2 exact):
        Points are the symmetric permutations of (1/6, 1/6),
        returned in the following fixed order:
            (1/6, 1/6)      → weight = 1/6
            (2/3, 1/6)      → weight = 1/6
            (1/6, 2/3)      → weight = 1/6

    4-point rule (degree-3 exact):
        Points include the centroid plus symmetric permutations of (0.6, 0.2),
        returned in the following fixed order:
            (1/3, 1/3)      → weight = -27/96
            (0.6, 0.2)      → weight =  25/96
            (0.2, 0.6)      → weight =  25/96
            (0.2, 0.2)      → weight =  25/96

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_pts : int
        Number of quadrature points. Must be one of {1, 3, 4}.

    Returns
    -------
    points : (num_pts, 2) ndarray of float64
        Quadrature points (ξ, η). The third barycentric coordinate is 1 − ξ − η.
        Points are returned in the fixed canonical order listed above.
    weights : (num_pts,) ndarray of float64
        Corresponding quadrature weights. The sum of weights equals 0.5,
        the area of the reference triangle.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `num_pts` is not one of {1, 3, 4}.

    Notes
    -----
    - The ordering of points and weights is deterministic and part of the function’s API.
    - These are standard FEM quadrature rules commonly used for linear and quadratic
      triangular elements.
    - Coordinates are expressed in the reference triangle domain (ξ, η), not in barycentric form.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_triangle_quadrature_2D_invalid_inputs: "Test that triangle_quadrature_2D rejects invalid numbers of points.

The quadrature rule only supports 1, 3, or 4 integration points.
Any other request should raise a ValueError."
- test_triangle_quadrature_2D_basics: "Test basic structural properties of the quadrature rule.

For each supported rule (1, 3, 4 points):
- The returned points and weights arrays have the correct shapes and dtypes.
- The weights sum to 1/2, which is the exact area of the reference triangle.
- All quadrature points lie inside the reference triangle, i.e.
  x >= 0, y >= 0, and x + y <= 1."
- test_triangle_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_1pt: "Accuracy of the 1-point centroid rule.

This rule is exact for total degree ≤ 1. We verify exactness on monomials {1, x, y},
then demonstrate non-exactness on representative quadratic monomials {x^2, xy, y^2}."
- test_triangle_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_3pt: "Accuracy of the classic 3-point rule.

This rule is exact for total degree ≤ 2. We verify exactness on monomials
{1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2}, then demonstrate non-exactness on representative
cubic monomials {x^3, x^2 y, x y^2, y^3}."
- test_triangle_quadrature_2D_degree_exactness_4pt: "Accuracy of the 4-point rule.

This rule is exact for total degree ≤ 3. We verify exactness on all monomials with p+q ≤ 3,
then demonstrate non-exactness on representative quartic monomials {x^4, x^3 y, x^2 y^2, x y^3, y^4}."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
