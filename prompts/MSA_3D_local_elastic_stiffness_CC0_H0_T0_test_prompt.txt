# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_local_elastic_stiffness_CC0_H0_T0(E: float, nu: float, A: float, L: float, Iy: float, Iz: float, J: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return the 12×12 local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam element.

    The beam is assumed to be aligned with the local x-axis. The stiffness matrix
    relates local nodal displacements and rotations to forces and moments using the equation:

        [force_vector] = [stiffness_matrix] @ [displacement_vector]

    Degrees of freedom are ordered as:
        [u1, v1, w1, θx1, θy1, θz1, u2, v2, w2, θx2, θy2, θz2]

    Where:
        - u, v, w: displacements along local x, y, z
        - θx, θy, θz: rotations about local x, y, z
        - Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to node i and node j of the element

    Parameters:
        E (float): Young's modulus
        nu (float): Poisson's ratio (used for torsion only)
        A (float): Cross-sectional area
        L (float): Length of the beam element
        Iy (float): Second moment of area about the local y-axis
        Iz (float): Second moment of area about the local z-axis
        J (float): Torsional constant

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A 12×12 symmetric stiffness matrix representing axial, torsional,
                    and bending stiffness in local coordinates.
    """

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_local_stiffness_3D_beam: "Comprehensive test for local_elastic_stiffness_matrix_3D_beam:
- shape check
- symmetry
- expected singularity due to rigid body modes
- block-level verification of axial, torsion, and bending terms"
- test_cantilever_deflection_matches_euler_bernoulli: "Apply a perpendicular point load in the z direction to the tip of a cantilever beam and verify that the computed displacement matches the analytical solution from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
Apply a perpendicular point load in the y direction to the tip of a cantilever beam and verify that the computed displacement matches the analytical solution from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
Apply a parallel point load in the x direction to the tip of a cantilever beam and verify that the computed displacement matches the analytical solution from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
