# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def FEM_1D_uniform_mesh_CC0_H0_T0(x_min: float, x_max: float, num_elements: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate a 1D linear uniform mesh with evenly spaced nodes.

    Parameters:
        x_min (float): Start coordinate of the domain.
        x_max (float): End coordinate of the domain.
        num_elements (int): Number of linear elements.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
            node_coords: 1D array of node coordinates (shape: [num_nodes]).
            element_connectivity: 2D array of element connectivity 
                (shape: [num_elements, 2]), where each row lists the two node indices of an element.

    Notes:
        - Node coordinates increase uniformly from x_min to x_max.
        - Elements are numbered sequentially from 0 to num_elements - 1.
        - Node indices increase monotonically along the domain.
    """

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_basic_mesh_creation: "Test basic 1D uniform mesh creation for correctness.

This test verifies that the provided mesh-generation function produces
the expected node coordinates and element connectivity for a simple
1D domain with uniform spacing."
- test_single_element_mesh: "Test mesh generation for the edge case of a single 1D element.

This test checks that the mesh-generation function correctly handles
the minimal valid case of one linear element spanning a domain from
x_min to x_max. It ensures the function properly computes both node
coordinates and connectivity for this degenerate case."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
