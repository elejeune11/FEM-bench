# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def FEM_2D_quad8_shape_fcns_and_derivatives_CC0_H0_T0(xi: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Vectorized evaluation of quadratic (8-node) quadrilateral shape functions and derivatives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xi : np.ndarray
        Natural coordinates (ξ, η) in the reference square.
        - Shape (2,) for a single point, or (n, 2) for a batch of points.
        - Components must be finite (no NaN or Inf). Domain is typically [-1, 1]^2.

    Returns
    -------
    N : np.ndarray
        Shape functions evaluated at the input points. Shape: (n, 8, 1).
        Node order: [N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8].
    dN_dxi : np.ndarray
        Partial derivatives w.r.t. (ξ, η). Shape: (n, 8, 2).
        Columns correspond to [∂()/∂ξ, ∂()/∂η] in the same node order.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `xi` is not a NumPy array.
        If `xi` has shape other than (2,) or (n, 2).
        If `xi` contains non-finite values (NaN or Inf).

    Notes
    -----
    Shape functions:
        N1 = -1/4 (1-ξ)(1-η)(1+ξ+η)
        N2 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1-η)(ξ-η-1)
        N3 =  +1/4 (1+ξ)(1+η)(ξ+η-1)
        N4 =  +1/4 (1-ξ)(1+η)(η-ξ-1)
        N5 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1-η)
        N6 =  +1/2 (1+ξ)(1-η²)
        N7 =  +1/2 (1-ξ²)(1+η)
        N8 =  +1/2 (1-ξ)(1-η²)
    """

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_quad8_shape_functions_and_derivatives_input_errors: "The quad8 vectorized evaluator requires a NumPy array input of shape (2,) or (n, 2)
with finite values. Invalid inputs must raise ValueError. This test feeds a set of
bad inputs (wrong type, wrong shape, non-finite) and asserts ValueError is raised."
- test_partition_of_unity_quad8: "Shape functions on a quadrilateral must satisfy the partition of unity:
∑_{i=1}^8 N_i(ξ,η) = 1 for all (ξ,η) in the reference square [-1,1] × [-1,1].
This test evaluates ∑ N_i at selected sample points (corners, mid-sides,
and centroid) and ensures that the sum equals 1 within tight tolerance."
- test_derivative_partition_of_unity_quad8: "Partition of unity implies ∑_i ∇N_i(ξ,η) = (0,0) for all (ξ,η) in [-1,1]×[-1,1].
This test evaluates the gradient sum at selected points (corners, mid-sides, centroid).
For every sample point, the vector sum equals (0,0) within tight tolerance."
- test_kronecker_delta_at_nodes_quad8: "For Q8 quadrilaterals, N_i equals 1 at its own node and 0 at all others.
This test evaluates N at each of the 8 reference nodes and assembles an 8×8 matrix
whose (i,j) entry is N_i at node_j. The matrix should equal the identity."
- test_value_completeness_quad8: "Check that quadratic (Q8) quad shape functions exactly reproduce
degree-1 and degree-2 polynomials. Nodal values are set from the exact
polynomial, the field is interpolated at sample points, and the maximum
error is verified to be nearly zero."
- test_gradient_completeness_quad8: "Check that Q8 quad shape functions reproduce the exact gradient for
degree-1 and degree-2 polynomials. Gradients are reconstructed from nodal
values and compared with the analytic gradient at sample points, with
maximum error verified to be nearly zero."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
