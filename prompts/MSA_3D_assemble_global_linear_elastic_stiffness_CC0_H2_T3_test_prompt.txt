# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_assemble_global_linear_elastic_stiffness_CC0_H2_T3(node_coords, elements):
    """
    Assemble the global stiffness matrix for a 3D linear-elastic frame structure composed of beam elements.

    Each 2-node Euler–Bernoulli beam contributes a 12×12 local elastic stiffness matrix
    based on its material and geometric properties (E, ν, A, I_y, I_z, J, L).
    The local matrix is expressed in the element’s coordinate system and includes
    axial, bending, and torsional stiffness terms.

    For global assembly, each local stiffness is transformed into global coordinates
    using a 12×12 direction-cosine transformation matrix (Γ) derived from the element’s
    start and end node coordinates and, if provided, an orientation vector (local_z).
    The global stiffness matrix K is formed by adding these transformed
    element matrices into the appropriate degree-of-freedom positions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : ndarray of shape (n_nodes, 3)
        Array containing the (x, y, z) coordinates of each node.

    elements : list of dict
        A list of element dictionaries. Each dictionary must contain:
            - 'node_i', 'node_j' : int
                Indices of the start and end nodes.
            - 'E' : float
                Young's modulus of the element.
            - 'nu' : float
                Poisson's ratio of the element.
            - 'A' : float
                Cross-sectional area.
            - 'I_y', 'I_z' : float
                Second moments of area about local y and z axes.
            - 'J' : float
                Torsional constant.
            - 'local_z' : array-like of shape (3,), optional
                Unit vector in global coordinates defining the local z-axis orientation.
                Must not be parallel to the beam axis. If None, a default is chosen.
                Default local_z = global z, unless the beam lies along global z — then default local_z = global y.

    Returns
    -------
    K : ndarray of shape (6 * n_nodes, 6 * n_nodes)
        The assembled global stiffness matrix of the structure, with 6 degrees of freedom per node.

    Notes
    -----
    - Local matrices are computed assuming Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and small displacements.
    - Each element’s local stiffness is rotated into global coordinates using K_g = Γᵀ K_l Γ.
    - Elements sharing nodes contribute additively to common global DOFs.
    - Reference vectors (local_z) must be unit length and not parallel to the beam axis.
    - Degrees of freedom per node follow the order: [u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z].
    - Assumes all elements are linearly elastic and connected via shared nodes.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_assemble_global_stiffness_matrix_shape_and_symmetry: "Tests that the global stiffness matrix assembly function produces a symmetric matrix of correct shape,
and that each element contributes a nonzero 12x12 block to the appropriate location.

Covers multiple structural configurations, for example: single element, linear chain, triangle loop, and square loop."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
