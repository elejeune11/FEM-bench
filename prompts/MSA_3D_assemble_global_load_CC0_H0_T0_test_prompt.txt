# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_assemble_global_load_CC0_H0_T0(nodal_loads: dict, n_nodes: int):
    """
    Assemble the global nodal load vector for a 3D linear-elastic frame structure.
    Constructs the global right-hand-side vector (P) for the equilibrium equation:
        K * u = P
    where K is the assembled global stiffness matrix and u is the global displacement
    vector. Each node contributes up to six DOFs corresponding to forces and moments
    in the global Cartesian frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodal_loads : dict[int, array-like of float]
        Mapping from node index (0-based) to a 6-component load vector:
            [F_x, F_y, F_z, M_x, M_y, M_z]
        representing forces (N) and moments (N·m) applied at that node in
        **global coordinates**. Nodes not listed are assumed to have zero loads.
    n_nodes : int
        Total number of nodes in the structure. Must be consistent with the
        indexing used in `nodal_loads`.
    Returns
    -------
    P : (6 * n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global load vector containing all nodal forces and moments.
        DOF ordering per node: [UX, UY, UZ, RX, RY, RZ].
        Entries for unconstrained or unloaded nodes are zero.
    Notes
    -----
    - DOF indices are 0-based and grouped sequentially by node:
        DOFs for node n → [6*n, 6*n+1, 6*n+2, 6*n+3, 6*n+4, 6*n+5].
    - Loads are assumed to be applied in the global coordinate system.
    - Input vectors are automatically converted to float.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_MSA_3D_assemble_global_load_CC0_H0_T0_comprehensive: "Comprehensive correctness test for MSA_3D_assemble_global_load_CC0_H0_T0:
- Basic correctness (single and multiple nodes)
- Zeros for unspecified nodes, proper global indexing
- Randomized consistency vs manual reference assembly"

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
