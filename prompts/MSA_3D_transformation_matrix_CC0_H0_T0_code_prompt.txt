# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports:
import numpy as np
from typing import Callable, Optional
import pytest
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)

## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def MSA_3D_transformation_matrix_CC0_H0_T0(x1: float, y1: float, z1: float, x2: float, y2: float, z2: float, reference_vector: Optional[np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute the 12x12 transformation matrix Gamma for a 3D beam element.

    This transformation relates the element's local coordinate system to the global system:
        K_global = Gamma.T @ K_local @ Gamma
    where K_global is the global stiffness matrix and K_local is the local stiffness matrix.

    Parameters:
        x1, y1, z1 (float): Coordinates of the beam's start node in global space.
        x2, y2, z2 (float): Coordinates of the beam's end node in global space.
        reference_vector (np.ndarray of shape (3,), optional): A unit vector in global coordinates used to define
            the orientation of the local y-axis. The local y-axis is computed as the cross product
            of the reference vector and the local x-axis (beam axis). The local z-axis is then
            computed as the cross product of the local x-axis and the local y-axes.

            If not provided:
            - If the beam is aligned with the global z-axis, the global y-axis is used.
            - Otherwise, the global z-axis is used.

    Returns:
        Gamma (np.ndarray): A 12x12 local-to-global transformation matrix used to transform
            stiffness matrices, displacements, and forces. It is composed of four repeated
            3x3 direction cosine submatrices along the diagonal.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `reference_vector` is not a unit vector.
        ValueError: If `reference_vector` is parallel to the beam axis.
        ValueError: If the `reference_vector` doesn't have shape (3,).
        ValueError: If the beam has zero length (start and end nodes coincide).

    Notes:
        All vectors must be specified in a right-handed global Cartesian coordinate system.
