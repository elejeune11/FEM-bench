# Python Function Implementation Task

Write a Python function that matches the exact signature and docstring provided below.

## Requirements:
- Keep the function name, parameter names, and docstring exactly as shown
- Do not add any code outside the function definition
- Use only the following imports:
import math
import numpy as np
import pytest
from typing import Callable, Tuple
- You may call only the helper functions listed below — their full implementations are provided
- Do not re-implement or modify them
- Output only valid Python code (no explanations, comments, or markdown)
- Implement the functionality as described in the docstring

## Available Helper Functions:
(None)

## Function Signature:
## Only complete the function below:
def FEM_2D_tri_quadrature_CC0_H0_T0(num_pts: int) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Return quadrature points and weights for numerical integration
    over the reference triangle T = {(x, y): x >= 0, y >= 0, x + y <= 1}.

    Supported rules (standard FEM triangular quadrature)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    1-point rule (degree-1 exact):
        Points and weights:
            (1/3, 1/3)      → weight = 0.5

    3-point rule (degree-2 exact):
        Points are the symmetric permutations of (1/6, 1/6),
        returned in the following fixed order:
            (1/6, 1/6)      → weight = 1/6
            (2/3, 1/6)      → weight = 1/6
            (1/6, 2/3)      → weight = 1/6

    4-point rule (degree-3 exact):
        Points include the centroid plus symmetric permutations of (0.6, 0.2),
        returned in the following fixed order:
            (1/3, 1/3)      → weight = -27/96
            (0.6, 0.2)      → weight =  25/96
            (0.2, 0.6)      → weight =  25/96
            (0.2, 0.2)      → weight =  25/96

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_pts : int
        Number of quadrature points. Must be one of {1, 3, 4}.

    Returns
    -------
    points : (num_pts, 2) ndarray of float64
        Quadrature points (ξ, η). The third barycentric coordinate is 1 − ξ − η.
        Points are returned in the fixed canonical order listed above.
    weights : (num_pts,) ndarray of float64
        Corresponding quadrature weights. The sum of weights equals 0.5,
        the area of the reference triangle.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `num_pts` is not one of {1, 3, 4}.

    Notes
    -----
    - The ordering of points and weights is deterministic and part of the function’s API.
    - These are standard FEM quadrature rules commonly used for linear and quadratic
      triangular elements.
    - Coordinates are expressed in the reference triangle domain (ξ, η), not in barycentric form.
