# Python Task: Write Pytest Tests for a Function

Below is the function you are testing. Use its signature and docstring to understand its behavior.

## Only complete the test functions below:
def MSA_3D_assemble_global_geometric_stiffness_CC1_H4_T2(node_coords: np.ndarray, elements: Sequence[dict], u_global: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Assemble the global geometric (initial-stress) stiffness matrix K_g for a 3D frame
    under a given global displacement state.

    Each 2-node Euler–Bernoulli beam contributes a 12×12 local geometric stiffness
    matrix k_g^local that depends on the element length and the internal end
    force/moment resultants induced by the current displacement state. The local
    matrix is then mapped to global coordinates with a 12×12 direction-cosine
    transformation Γ and scattered into the global K_g.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_coords : (n_nodes, 3) ndarray of float
        Global Cartesian coordinates [x, y, z] of each node (0-based indexing).
    elements : sequence of dict
        Per-element dictionaries. Required keys per element:
            'E' : float
                Young's modulus (Pa).
            'nu' : float
                Poisson's ratio (unitless).
            'A' : float
                Cross-sectional area (m²).
            'I_y', 'I_z' : float
                Second moments of area about the local y- and z-axes (m⁴).
            'J' : float
                Torsional constant (m⁴).
            'local_z' : array-like of shape (3,), optional
                Unit vector in global coordinates defining the local z-axis orientation.
                Must not be parallel to the beam axis. If None, a default is chosen (see Notes).
    u_global : (6*n_nodes,) ndarray of float
        Global displacement vector with 6 DOF per node in the order
        [u_x, u_y, u_z, θ_x, θ_y, θ_z] for node 0, then node 1, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    K : (6*n_nodes, 6*n_nodes) ndarray of float
        Assembled global geometric stiffness matrix. For conservative loading and
        the standard formulation, K_g is symmetric.

    Notes
    -----
    - Local axes are right-handed.
    - Default orientation rule for `local_z` (reference vector): use the global z-axis
      unless the beam axis is aligned with global z, in which case use the global y-axis.
      The 'local_z' must be unit length and not parallel to the beam axis.
    - Internal end forces used to parameterize k_g^local are elastic internal reactions
      induced by the supplied displacement state (not external loads). Their local DOF
      ordering is the same as for local displacements:
      [u1, v1, w1, θx1, θy1, θz1, u2, v2, w2, θx2, θy2, θz2] ↔
      [Fx_i, Fy_i, Fz_i, Mx_i, My_i, Mz_i, Fx_j, Fy_j, Fz_j, Mx_j, My_j, Mz_j].
    - Elements that share nodes contribute additively to common global DOFs.
    - A zero-length element or invalid `local_z` (non-unit or parallel to the axis)
      should be treated as an error by the transformation routine.

    External Dependencies
    ---------------------
    local_geometric_stiffness_matrix_3D_beam(L, A, I_rho, Fx2, Mx2, My1, Mz1, My2, Mz2) -> (12,12) ndarray
        Must return the local geometric stiffness using the element length L, section properties, and local end force resultants as shown.

## Your Goal:
Write pytest-style test functions that verify the correctness of the function above.

## Requirements:
- Use the exact test function names listed below
- Each test must accept a single argument: `fcn` — the function to test
- Use `assert` statements to check correctness
- Each test must include a descriptive docstring
- Do not include print statements, logging, or example usage
- Output only valid Python code — no explanations, markdown, or comments

## Test Functions to Implement:
- test_multi_element_core_correctness_assembly: "Verify basic correctness of assemble_global_geometric_stiffness_3D_beam
for a simple 3-node, 2-element chain. Checks that:
  1) zero displacement produces a zero matrix,
  2) the assembled matrix is symmetric,
  3) scaling displacements scales K_g linearly,
  4) superposition holds for independent displacement states, and
  5) element order does not affect the assembled result."
- test_frame_objectivity_under_global_rotation: "Verify frame objectivity of assemble_global_geometric_stiffness_3D_beam.

Rotating the entire system (geometry, local axes, and displacement field) by
a global rotation R should produce a geometric stiffness matrix K_g^rot that
satisfies: K_g^rot ≈ T K_g T^T, where T is block-diagonal with per-node blocks
diag(R, R) acting on [u_x,u_y,u_z, rx,ry,rz]."

# Output:
# Only return valid pytest test functions — no prose, markdown, or commentary.
