prompt: |
  Implement a function to compute 1D quadratic shape functions for a three-node element.
  
  The shape functions should satisfy:
  - Partition of unity: N1(xi) + N2(xi) + N3(xi) = 1
  - Interpolation property at nodes xi = -1, 0, 1
  
  where xi is the natural coordinate ranging from -1 to 1.
